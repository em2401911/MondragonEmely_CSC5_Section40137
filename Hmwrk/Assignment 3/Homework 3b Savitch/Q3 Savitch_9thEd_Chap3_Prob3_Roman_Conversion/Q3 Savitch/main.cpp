/* 
 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Dr. Mark E. Lehr
 * Created on January 2, 2019, 12:36 PM
 * Purpose:  Write a program that accepts a year written as a four-digit 
 * Arabic (ordinary) numeral and outputs the year written in Roman numerals. 
 * Important Roman numerals are V for 5, 
 * X for 10, 
 * L for 50, 
 * C for 100, 
 * D for 500, 
 * and M for 1,000. 
 * Recall that some numbers are formed by using a kind of subtraction of one 
 * Roman “digit”; for example, 
 * IV is 4 produced as V minus I, 
 * XL is 40, 
 * CM is 900, 
 * and so on. 
 * A few sample years: MCM is 1900, 
 * MCML is 1950, 
 * MCMLX is 1960, 
 * MCMXL is 1940, 
 * MCMLXXXIX is 1989. 
 * Assume the year is between 1000 and 3000.
 * To determine how many 1's,10's,100's,1000's
 * x=32497; let 
 * n1=(x)%10  ->  n1=7
 * n10=(x/10)%10; ->  n10=9
 * n100=(x/100)%10; -> n100=4
 * n1000=(x/1000)%10; -> n1000=2
