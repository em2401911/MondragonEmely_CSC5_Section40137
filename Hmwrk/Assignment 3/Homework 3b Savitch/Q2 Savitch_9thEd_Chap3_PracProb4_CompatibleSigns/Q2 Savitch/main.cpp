 * Purpose:  Horoscope Signs of the same Element are most compatible. 
 * There are 4 Elements in astrology, and 3 Signs in each: 
 * FIRE (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), 
 * EARTH (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), 
 * AIR (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) , 
 * WATER (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces). 
 * According to some astrologers, you are most comfortable with your own sign 
 * and the other two signs in your Element. 
 * For example, Aries would be most comfortable with other Aries 
 * and the two other FIRE signs, Leo and Sagittarius.
