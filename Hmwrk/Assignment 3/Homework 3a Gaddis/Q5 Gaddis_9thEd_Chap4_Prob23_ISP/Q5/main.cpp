/*An Internet service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:

Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hours

are $2.00 per hour.

Package B: For $14.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours

are $1.00 per hour.

Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.

Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package

the customer has purchased and how many hours were used. It should then display

the total amount due.

Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C. Also, the number

of hours used in a month cannot exceed 744.*/
