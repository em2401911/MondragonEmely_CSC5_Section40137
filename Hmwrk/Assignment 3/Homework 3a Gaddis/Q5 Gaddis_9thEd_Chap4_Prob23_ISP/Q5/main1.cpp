 * Purpose: An Internet service provider has three different 
 * subscription packages for its customers:
 * Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. 
 * Additional hours are $2.00 per hour.
 * Package B: For $14.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. 
 * Additional hours are $1.00 per hour.
 * Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.
 * Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. 
 * It should ask which package the customer has purchased 
 * and how many hours were used. It should then display the total amount due. 
 * Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C. 
 * Also, the number of hours used in a month cannot exceed 744.
