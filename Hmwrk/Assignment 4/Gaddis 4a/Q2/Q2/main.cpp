 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Emely Mondragon
 * Created on January 16, 2019, 1:23 PM
 * Purpose: Write a program that calculates how much a person would earn 
 * over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day 
 * and two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day. 
 * The program should ask the user for the number of days.
 * The output earnings should be displayed in a dollar amount, 
 * not the number of pennies.
 * Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 
 * for the number of days worked.
